# ARM：A RANSAC-based method for Automatic Reverse Modeling of incomplete point clouds
This repository provides source code for our paper:

# Paper Post-Acceptance Code Open-Source Project

This repository hosts some of the key code developed during our research. Since the paper is still under review, we are currently providing a pre-release version of the code only. The complete reproduction steps and related files will be made publicly available once the paper is accepted. Thank you for your interest and understanding!

## Project Overview

- **Pre-release Content:**  
  This repository currently includes a subset of the core algorithms and data processing scripts that demonstrate our research approach and framework.
  
- **Future Updates:**  
  Upon the official acceptance of the paper, the full code base—including complete reproduction steps, configuration files, and additional documentation—will be released. This will facilitate reproducibility and further development by interested researchers.
